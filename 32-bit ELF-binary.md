# Reverse Engineering: Lab05- 32-bit ELF-binary

## Main function of the program

The code begins with the standard preamble. This sets up the stack frame and allocates memory for local variables. The string "serial key: " is printed to prompt the user for input. Input is read using scanf with “%s” as an argument. It is stored in a buffer as a string. This is passed to the check_serial function for validation.The result is checked.

• _time: This function to retrieving the current time.

• _stand: to initialize the serial key number.

• _memset: to initial a block of memory [var_17] set to zero.

• _printf: to print the string “Insert serial key” to the console, prompting
the user input.

• ___isoc99_scanf: it is readying user input and check if it is string.

• Check_serial: to check the user input validation.

• word ptr: it means the following operand is a 16-bit value located in memory
at a particular address. Reverse assembly is often used in debugging and
reverse engineering to understand the low-level details of a program or
binary executable.

### Check serial function

The begin of this function start with set of codes to check the length of a string as user input, it is obtained from the function argument =19 characters, and if True jump to location in the memory call loc_804920A for further instructions.

After checking the condition, the function starts to set the serial instructions and from the construction of the flow of the code we found:

• The key has 4 sets and in total are 16 and as we know that the key should be 19 so still 3 characters are still missing.

• Notice the code it is increasing by one and every 4 steps will pass one, so from the code below we can see the first 4 codes it is loading 8-bits(byte) from the memory and add 1 to the value in the register ecx and on the step 5

It is pass the 5th character so we know the forth character is missing and this is continue for the other 3 sets so, we can set it to – or / or any other special character except white space as we tested on the console, Now we know we

have key set like xxx-xxxx-xxx-xxx which in total it is 19

movsx ecx, byte ptr [ecx]

movsx ecx, byte ptr [ecx+1]

movsx ecx, byte ptr [ecx+2]

movsx ecx, byte ptr [ecx+3]

movsx ecx, byte ptr [ecx+5]

• The second step was to find that there are only two hexa numbers used as an argument with ‘and’ which are 400h and 800h

400h=0000 0100 0000 0000

800h=0000 1000 000 0000
![loc function](https://github.com/Mays-M/Images-/blob/main/loc.png) 

From this point I started to digging to know what the actual job of the function is
**__ctype_b_loc** and I found that this function:

• The __ctype_b_loc() function shall return a pointer into an array of characters in the current locale that contains characteristics for each character in the current character set.

![arrguments](https://github.com/Mays-M/Images-/blob/main/arrguments.png)  

Now to apply this on the two hexa number we had in our program, we found it is return number on 800h and alphabets on 400h.
![arrguments](https://github.com/Mays-M/Images-/blob/main/excel.png) 

In this point we still missing the arrange of the set of the key and from our code, I followed the use of 400h and 800h found it is return a set like this:
 
 NAAN-NNAA-AANN-NNNA

*’N ‘presents 800h which is a Number and ‘A ‘presents 400h which is a letter.

## The Result
The serial key is 4 sets divided by -, it is alpha and numbers with no white space. The
character set base on the flow of the code as show in the figure above and tested on
5 different keys fellow the same instruction to generate a key base on the code instruction.
